# Given a sorted array arr[] of size n, the goal is to rearrange the array so that all distinct
# elements appear at the beginning in sorted order.
# Additionally, return the length of this distinct sorted subarray.
#
# Note: The elements after the distinct ones can be in any order and hold any value, as they donâ€™t affect the result.
#
# Examples:
#
# Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
# Output: [2]
# Explanation: All the elements are 2, So only keep one instance of 2.
#
#
# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5]
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#
# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
# Output: [1, 2, 3]
# Explanation : No change as all elements are distinct.
