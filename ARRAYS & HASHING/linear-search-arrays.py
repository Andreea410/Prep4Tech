# Given an array, arr of n integers, and an integer element x,
# find whether element x is present in the array.
# Return the index of the first occurrence of x in the array, or -1 if it doesn’t exist.
#
# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There is one test case with array as [1, 2, 3 4] and element to be searched as 3.
# Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.
#
#
# Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], x = 5
# Output: 4
# Explanation: For array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the element to be searched is 5 and it is at index 4.
# So, the output is 4.
#
#
# Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30], x = 6
# Output: -1
# Explanation: The element to be searched is 6 and its not present, so we return -1.
